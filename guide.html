        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px">
            A "Coding Helper" is a <b>staff position</b> within our server that demonstrates your profound understanding of programming.<br/>
            If accepted, you are expected to volunteer your time to help the community members solve their programming issues.<br/> <br/>
            
            <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 35px">What are our requirements?</h2> 

            <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
                <li><b>Activity.</b> This is our number one requirement as we need to complete all the help requests we receive.</li>
                <li><b>Maturity.</b> Part of being on our staff team is having a mature attitude.  You MUST show maturity within our server to be a helper.</li>
                <li><b>Proficiency.</b> To successfuly help our members, we require that you have an advanced understanding of a programming language.</li>
                <li><b>Respectfulness.</b> As the face of the community, you must show respect to all members while helping & interacting them.  This includes admins/mods & other helpers.</li>

                <p>
                    These are the <b>minimum</b> standards we look for in the coding helper applications we receive.<br/>  
                    With that in mind, its best practice to ensure that you have met these standards before applying.  If you have any requirement questions, don't hesitate to DM @modmail on Discord!

            <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 35px">How do we review apps?</h2>
            
            <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
                <p>
                    We understand that knowing the reviewal process for applications such as this allow you to better your chances at getting accepted<br/>
                    With that in mind, here are all of the steps we take to review your coding helper application, including time, process, and more.<br/> <br/>

                    <b>Expected Time:</b> we operate our application reviews on a monthly cycle.  First we accept applications, then the new helpers become <b>trial helpers.</b><br/>
                    All trial helpers typically have a minimum of 20-30 days of their trial period before they can become actual coding helpers. During this time,<br/>
                    the trial helpers show how they help, how active they are, and more.  We <b>DO NOT</b> review applications during current trial periods. This<br/>
                    Once the trial period is over, we complete promotions and demotions of the trial helpers based on their trial period. Following demotions, our<br/>
                    next cycle of applications is then reviewed by admins. In total, you should expect to hear back from us within <b>30 days</b> of submitting your app.<br/> <br/>
                    
                    <b>Review Process:</b> now that we are reviewing your application, there are some steps we take to make our decision. First, we read your application,<br/>
                    we look at all of your responses, and take in to consideration the programming language you want to help with. After getting an understanding of<br/>
                    who you are, and the general information about you, we take a look at your <b>messages</b> within our server.  We look for the standards set above,<br/>
                    this means we are looking for how you act within the server- respectfulness, <b>activity</b>, proficiency, maturity, and how much you currently help members.<br/>
                    After taking all this information into account, the administration team makes their decision to either accept you into your trial phase, or deny your app.<br/> <br/>

                    <b>How We Respond:</b> after your application is reviewed, you will receive your results via email.  The email you provide in the application is the email<br/>
                    that we will send the results to; providing a fake email will result in your results not being received.  If you are denied, you will receive a basic reason of why,<br/>
                    however, we will not go into detail on your full application results. If you get accepted, you will receive more information on your trial phase, and your responsibilities<br/>
                    moving forward.<br/> <br/>

                    Having <b>patience</b> is very important while we review your application.  Applicants that show signs of impatience such as asking about the status of their app, constantly bringing it up,<br/>
                    or even getting annoyed about the lack of response are typically denied.  Maintaining all of the requirements and having patience during the reviewal time is the best way to get accepted.<br/>

                <p>
                    <li>Will it help to DM @modmail regarding my application?  Yes and no. DMing @modmail with questions to better your application is usually a good thing,<br/>
                    and we will be happy to answer them.  However, if you are DMing @modmail for your application's status, your ticket will be closed as we cannot provide<br/>
                    an exact time that you will hear back from us.</li><br/>
                    <li>We <i>mostly</i> look for activity in our coding helper applications. Ideally, applicants should be active and helping members at least once a day.<br/>
                    furthermore, maintaining this level of activity during your application process is ideal if you want to get accepted. Most members<br/>
                    get accepted, and then go inactive during the trial phase- be sure to maintain activity even after being accepted.</li><br/>
